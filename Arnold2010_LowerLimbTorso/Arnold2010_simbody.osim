        DETAILED COMMENTS AND REFERENCES FOR USE WITH THE 14 SEGMENT KINEMATIC  MUSCULOSKELETAL MODEL CREATED BY EDITH M. ARNOLD: Arnoldetal2010_2Legs_Default.osim

        This file contains three options for muscle models:
        Thelen2003Muscle
        Schutte1993Muscle
        Delp1990Muscle

        This musculoskeletal model uses the Schutte1993Model because it is similar to the Delp1990Muscle, but should be more stable during ComputedMuscleControl.
        Exceptions: Back muscles were adapted from the OpenSim default model gait_2392 and remain as Thelen2003Muscle format.

        The definition of each muscle contains a list of coordinates that describe its line of action and the parameters (peak isometric force, optimal fiber length, tendon slack length, and pennation angle)  needed to compute isometric muscle force.  Additional parameters can be added to create a dynamics-based muscle model.

        The joint definitions describe the kinematics of a 14 segment, 7 degree-of-freedom model of the pelvis, torso, and left and right femur, patella, tibia, calcaneus, talus, and toes.

        The model represents a nominal adult male, and is based on the lower limb models developed by Delp et al. (1990) and A.S. Arnold (1999).  

        It includes the following modifications, relative to the Delp et al. model:

        1.  Expanded architecture data
        This architecture of these muscles is based on a study of 21 cadavers by Ward et al. (2009), an improvement over the data by Wickiewicz (1983) Friederich and Brand (1990)which included only 5 total.

        2.  Fiber length-joint angle relationship
        Ward et al. explicitly linked measured fiber lengths to joint angles. This allows examination of the fiber length operating range in relation to joint angle.

        3.  Experimentally based tendon lengths
        In the Delp model tendon lengths were set so that resultant passive moments matched experimental results.  In this model they were set  using an experimentally measured relationship between fiber length and joint angle.
        There are two options for semimembranosus tendon length:
            0.348 is representative of the experimental joint angle-fiber length relationship, but results in unrealistic passive forces at high hip flexion. This value is the default as it is most true to the architecture data.
            0.378 is gives more realistic passive behavior in high hip flexion angles, but fibers become very short in less extreme configurations(like walking).  This is value included in the paper of reference.
            Comment out the one you don't want to use.

        4.  Longer plantarflexor fibers
        In the Delp model the fiber lengths of soleus and the gastrocnemii were lengthened beyond the data reported by Wickiewicz et al.  This was necessary to achieve physiolgically reasonable results.  The plantarflexor fiber lengths measured by Ward et al. were longer and thus lengthening was not necessary.

        5.  Walker knee
        In this model, 3D tibiofemoral kinematics are based on experimental data published by Walker et al. (1988) and adapted from a SIMM model by A.S. Arnold et al. (2000) Knee flexion is positive and full extension is 0 degrees. 
        Walker, P. S., J. S. Rovick, and D. D. Robertson. The effects of knee brace hinge design and placement on joint mechanics. J. Biomech. 21:965-974, 1988.

        6.  Altered wrapping and attachment points
        Wrapping surfaces were added and some attachment points were modified to refine muscle paths and moment arms.  Additions are a combination of surfaces adapted from A.S. Arnold et al. (2000) and new surfaces.

        7.  Right and left hemipelves and sacrum were re-oriented.
        Adapted from A.S. Arnold et al. (2000)
        In this model, spatial relationships between the hemipelves and sacrum are more consistent with pelves constructed from MR images.    

        8.  Femur was re-digitized.  
        Adapted from A.S. Arnold et al. (2000)
        The femur from Delp's model (Specimen A55, Stanford University) was digitized at higher resolution.  

        9.  Tibia was replaced. 
        Adapted from A.S. Arnold et al. (2000)
        The tibia in Delp's model did not match the Specimen A55 femur.
        The tibia from Specimen A55 was digitized and used in place of the tibia in Delp's model.

        10.  Fibula was scaled by 97% and re-oriented. 
        Adapted from A.S. Arnold et al. (2000) 

        11.  Pelvis coordinate system was revised.
        Adapted from A.S. Arnold et al. (2000)  
        In this model, the "neutral position" was defined such that the ASISs and pubic tubercle lie in the frontal plane.  In Delp's model, the "neutral position" was defined to be coincident with the anatomical position. This difference corresponds to an offset in pelvic tilt and hip flexion angle of about 5 degrees.  This may also differ from a gait lab convention and care should be taken to ensure appropriate interpretations according to the convention used.

        REFERENCES FOR THE MUSCLE-TENDON PARAMETERS
        References are given for each musculotendon parameter in Table 1 of 
        Arnold, E.M., Ward, S.R., Lieber, R. L., and Delp, S.L., A model of the lower limb for analysis of human movement,

        LOCATION OF REFERENCE FRAMES
        Each musculotendon path is defined as series of three-dimensional coordinates.  Each coordinate is fixed in a body-segmental reference frame.  In the anatomical position, the X-axes point anteriorly, the Y-axes point
        superiorly, and the Z-axes point laterally.

        The location of these frames is as follows. 
        PELVIS:  The pelvic reference frame is fixed at the midpoint of the line connecting the two ASIS.
        FEMUR:  The femoral frame is fixed at the center of the femoral head
        TIBIA:   The tibial segment is located at the midpoint of the line between the medial and lateral femoral epicondyles.
        PATELLA: The patellar frame is located at the most distal point of the patella.
        TALUS:   The talar frame is located at the midpoint of the line between the apeces of the medial and lateral maleoli.
        CALCANUS: The calcaneal frame is located at the most distal, inferior point on the posterior surface of the calcaneus.
        TOES:    The toe frame is located at the base of the second metatarsal 

        Walker et al. used a different convention for the femur and tibia frame when describing the knee joint.  In the anatomical position the X-axis points medially (left), Y-axis points superiorly, Z-axis points anteriorly.  These frames are translated to the FEMUR and TIBIA frame via fixed joints.
        FEMUR_WLKR:  Located at the midpoint of the line between the medial and lateral femoral epicondyles.  
        TIBIA_WLKR:  Coincident with FEMUR_WLKR at knee_angle = 0 

        SHAFT_AXIS:  A fixed reference frame oriented along the line of the femur shaft used to simplify the placement of wrapping surfaces during model development.
